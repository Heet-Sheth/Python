I keep forgetting that python has no semicolons
I keep forgetting that python scope works via : and indentation no Curly braces
Upper range is exclusive in python
Lower range is optional and inclusive

"+" can concatenate strings only
, can do int and strings
, attaches 1 space for itself, so do not explicitely add for formatting

line is an inbuit string itarator containing a line in each iteration
with open auto closes a file
else if is elif
path/directory works with/out "./"
post/pre, increment/decrement operators aren't there in python, have to use shorthand
python paths are calculated from the CWD (current working directory) of the folder open as a context during running and not from the file that you are tring to work with.
the new line characters are there in the string if read as lines of a file
Strip is a smarter way to handle leading and trailing spaces.
